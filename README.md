**Simple Tool for Managing Active Microsoft 365 Users**


Managing Microsoft 365 users can be a challenging task, especially when trying to locate specific users based on attributes like **UserPrincipalName, DisplayName, Job Title, or Department**. The standard **Users > Active Users** screen in Microsoft 365 doesn’t inherently support **advanced filtering options** for these criteria. As a result, administrators often find themselves relying on cumbersome CSV reports or manually digging through user details to locate the intended target.

To simplify this process, we’re excited to introduce our **free Microsoft 365 user management tool**. Designed with administrators in mind, this tool **streamlines user search** and reporting tasks, saving time and effort.

**Key Features of the Tool**
